# Image Search Engine

## Overview
Image Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for images by keywords. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and fetches data from the Unsplash API.

## Features
- **Search for images**: Enter a keyword to find relevant images.

## How It Works
The application uses the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the Unsplash API. When a user enters a keyword and submits the form, an HTTP GET request is made to the API, which returns a collection of images related to the keyword. These images are then displayed on the webpage.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mukesh0902/ImageSearchEngine.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to run the application.

## Usage
Enter a keyword into the search box and press enter. The images related to the keyword will be displayed on the screen.
